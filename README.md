# ðŸŽ“ Welcome to the **Institute-Research-Publication-Simulation** ðŸŽ“

## Project Description
This project simulates the management and tracking of research publications by an institute. It uses object-oriented programming to model publications and authors, and allows searching publications by authors, parsing `.bib` files, and analyzing publication data.

The project is divided into three parts:
- **Question 1**: A program to model research publications using object-oriented programming concepts.
- **Question 2**: A program to parse a `.bib` file, validate its content, and store the data in a structured manner.
- **Question 3**: A program to query the publications of specific authors and calculate statistics about the average number of co-authors per publication.

## Building and Running the Project

- **Through common makefile**:
    make
    Then navigate to each folder to run the executable.

  Or execute individually.

- For **Question 1**:
  cd 'Question 1'
  make
  ./publication_tracker

- For **Question 2**:
  cd 'Question 2'
  make
  ./bibtex_processor

- For **Question 3**:
  cd 'Question 3'
  make
  ./bibtex_processor

## For cleaning up build up files

- make clean
